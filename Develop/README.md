  ## Description 

  Your GitHub profile is an extremely important aspect of your public identity as a developer. A well-crafted one allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers. An important component of your GitHub profile—and one that many new developers often overlook—is the README.md file.

  ## Installation
  There's no one right way to structure a good README. There is one very wrong way, however, and that is to not include a README at all or to create a very anemic one. This guide outlines a few best practices. As you progress in your career, you will develop your own ideas about what makes a good README.
  
  
  
  ## Usage
  If you used any third-party assets that require attribution, list the creators with links to their primary web presence in this section.
  
  
  
  ## Contribution 
  Badges aren't _necessary_, per se, but they demonstrate street cred.
  
  
  
  ## Testing
  o the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them.
